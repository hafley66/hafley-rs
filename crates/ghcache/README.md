# ghcache

A local caching proxy between the `gh` CLI and a normalized SQLite database.
GitHub data is synced into SQLite; local tools query SQLite directly -- no live API calls at read time.

## Quick start

```sh
# Option A: guided TUI
ghcache setup

# Option B: manual
ghcache init          # write ghcache.toml template
$EDITOR ghcache.toml  # edit owner/repos
ghcache sync          # full initial sync
ghcache watch         # continuous polling loop
```

## Setup (guided TUI)

`ghcache setup` runs interactive terminal prompts, writes `ghcache.toml`, and runs the initial sync.

```sh
ghcache setup

# Write the config to a custom path:
ghcache --config ~/.config/ghcache/config.toml setup
```

The `ghcache-init` companion binary (Go + Charm huh) provides a richer multi-step form as an
alternative. It is not required -- setup works without it.

```sh
cd init-form
go build -o ghcache-init .
cp ghcache-init /usr/local/bin/   # or next to the ghcache binary
```

`ghcache-init` outputs JSON to stdout; pipe it wherever you like, or use it standalone to
generate config JSON for scripted setups.

## Demo (copy-paste)

`demo.sh` in the repo root runs the full demo automatically (builds the binary, writes a temp config
for an org, syncs, queries, and confirms 304 cache hits on the second pass). Just run it:

```sh
./demo.sh
```

Or step through it manually. Replace `yourname` with your GitHub login (`gh api user --jq '.login'`).

**1. Write a throw-away config**

To sync every repo under your account (replace `yourname`):

```sh
cat > /tmp/ghcache-demo.toml << 'EOF'
[global]
db_path   = "/tmp/ghcache-demo.db"
log_level = "warn"
gh_binary = "gh"

[[org]]
owner         = "yourname"
sync_prs      = true
sync_events   = true
sync_branches = ["main"]
exclude       = []          # repo names to skip
EOF
```

Or to target specific repos instead:

```sh
cat > /tmp/ghcache-demo.toml << 'EOF'
[global]
db_path   = "/tmp/ghcache-demo.db"
log_level = "warn"
gh_binary = "gh"

[[repo]]
owner          = "yourname"
name           = "your-repo"
default_branch = "main"
sync_prs       = true
sync_events    = true
sync_branches  = ["main"]
EOF
```

**2. First sync -- full sweep**

```sh
ghcache --config /tmp/ghcache-demo.toml sync
```

**3. Query the DB directly -- no API calls**

```sh
DB=/tmp/ghcache-demo.db

# branches with SHAs
sqlite3 $DB -column -header "
  SELECT r.owner||'/'||r.name AS repo, b.name AS branch, substr(b.sha,1,8) AS sha
  FROM branch b JOIN repo r ON r.id=b.repo_id;"

# open PRs
sqlite3 $DB -column -header "SELECT * FROM v_open_prs;"

# recent events
sqlite3 $DB -column -header "SELECT repo_slug, type, actor, created_at FROM v_recent_events LIMIT 10;"
```

**4. Second sync -- watch it be instant**

```sh
time ghcache --config /tmp/ghcache-demo.toml sync
```

**5. Confirm it was free (304 cache hits)**

```sh
sqlite3 $DB -column -header "
  SELECT endpoint, status_code, cache_hit, duration_ms
  FROM call_log ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 15;"
```

**6. Clean up**

```sh
rm /tmp/ghcache-demo.toml /tmp/ghcache-demo.db
```

## Config file search order

1. `--config <path>` flag (highest priority)
2. `$GHCACHE_CONFIG` environment variable
3. `./ghcache.toml` (current directory)
4. `~/.config/ghcache/config.toml`

## Config format

```toml
[global]
db_path              = "~/.local/share/ghcache/gh.db"
staging_folder       = "~/.local/share/ghcache/repos"  # git checkouts live here, next to the DB
poll_interval_seconds = 60
org_repo_discovery_interval_seconds = 3600  # repo-list discovery cadence; 0 = every sync pass
log_level            = "info"            # trace | debug | info | warn | error
gh_binary            = "gh"
sync_notifications   = false             # sync the authenticated user's personal notification inbox

# Sync every repo under a GitHub user or org account.
# Discovered at sync time via the GitHub repos API (ETag-gated, usually a free 304).
[[org]]
owner                = "myorg"
fs_alias             = "mo"              # optional: short name for staging_folder path
sync_prs             = true
sync_notifications   = true
sync_events          = true
sync_branches        = ["main"]
checkout_on_sync     = false             # keep local default branch ref fresh after sync/watch passes
checkout_pr_branches = false             # also mirror refs/pull/*/head into refs/remotes/pr/*/head
exclude              = ["archived-repo", "scratch"]   # repo names to skip

# Or target specific repos explicitly.
[[repo]]
owner                = "myorg"
name                 = "backend"
default_branch       = "main"
sync_prs             = true
sync_notifications   = true
sync_events          = true
sync_branches        = ["main", "staging", "release/*"]  # glob trailing * supported
checkout_on_sync     = false   # if true, watch updates local default branch refs
checkout_pr_branches = false   # if true, watch mirrors GitHub PR heads via git transport
```

### `fs_alias` -- shorter checkout paths

Both `[[org]]` and `[[repo]]` accept an optional `fs_alias` field. When set, the staging folder
uses this value instead of `owner` for the directory name on disk:

```toml
[[org]]
owner    = "my-extremely-long-organization-name"
fs_alias = "melo"
sync_prs = true
```

Without `fs_alias`: `{staging_folder}/my-extremely-long-organization-name/repo-name`
With `fs_alias`:    `{staging_folder}/melo/repo-name`

The alias only affects filesystem paths. API calls still use the real `owner` for GitHub requests.
Repos discovered via `[[org]]` inherit the org's `fs_alias`.

`[[org]]` and `[[repo]]` can coexist. Repos discovered via `[[org]]` that are also listed under `[[repo]]` will be synced twice (once with each config). Use `exclude` to avoid that.

## Global flags

| Flag | Short | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| `--config <path>` | | Override config file location |
| `--silent` | `-s` | Suppress JSON rate-limit summary lines on stdout |
| `--calls-to-stdout` | | Print each API call as a JSON line on stdout |

## Stdout JSON lines

Two independent streams, both on stdout, both in JSON Lines format (one object per line).

### Rate-limit summary (`--silent` suppresses)

After every API call, the current pool sizes are emitted:

```json
{"ts":"2026-03-25T10:00:00Z","rest_remaining":4800,"graphql_remaining":4950}
```

Both pools are always shown together (latest recorded value for each).

### Per-call detail (`--calls-to-stdout` enables)

Each individual API call emits its own line with the endpoint and cost:

REST:
```json
{"ts":"2026-03-25T10:00:00Z","endpoint":"/repos/myorg/backend/events","status":200,"rate_remaining":4800,"duration_ms":42}
```

GraphQL:
```json
{"ts":"2026-03-25T10:00:00Z","endpoint":"graphql:prs:full/myorg/backend","status":200,"rate_remaining":4950,"gql_cost":1,"duration_ms":150}
```

`gql_cost` is the GraphQL point cost reported by the GitHub API (null for REST calls).
This is how you see which query caused a rate-limit drop.

Pipe either stream through `jq` to filter:
```sh
ghcache --calls-to-stdout sync | jq 'select(.api_type == "graphql")'
```

## Commands

### `ghcache init`
Writes a `ghcache.toml` template to `~/.config/ghcache/config.toml` (creating the directory if needed)
and prints next steps. Falls back to `./ghcache.toml` if `dirs::config_dir()` is unavailable.

### `ghcache sync [--repo owner/name] [--prs] [--notifications] [--events]`
Full sweep sync: fetches all open PRs, events, notifications, and branches for every configured repo.
PR queries are batched (up to 20 repos per GraphQL call) to minimize API consumption.

- `--repo owner/name` restricts to one repo
- `--prs / --notifications / --events` restrict to one data type
- Always performs a full GraphQL PR fetch (not event-targeted)

### `ghcache watch [--no-sync] [--full-sweep] [--local-git-only]`
Continuous polling loop. On startup, skips the full sweep if the DB already has PR data from a
previous run. Subsequent iterations are event-targeted: org repos with no new events since the
last pass are skipped entirely (no API calls, no transaction). Only repos with activity get
their PRs and branches re-fetched. Most polls are free 304 responses.

Org repo discovery runs on watch startup, then uses `org_repo_discovery_interval_seconds`
between API calls. The default is `3600` seconds.

Each pass runs a checkout sweep over every `checkout_on_sync` repo, force-updating the
default branch (clean reset on the default branch; `branch -f` in the background when a
feature branch is checked out; untracked files are left in place, tracked edits are
stashed first). The sweep caps concurrent git/`gh` subprocesses at `8` so a few-hundred-repo
run does not thrash the machine; override with `GHCACHE_CHECKOUT_CONCURRENCY`.

- `--full-sweep` forces a complete PR re-fetch on startup even if data is cached
- `--no-sync` starts the HTTP server only, with no sync loop
- `--local-git-only` skips GitHub REST/GraphQL sync and only updates local Git clones/ref mirrors
- `--daemon` double-forks to background and redirects stdio to `/dev/null`

For repos with `checkout_on_sync = true` or `checkout_pr_branches = true`: if the local clone
is missing, `gh repo clone` runs once. Existing clones force-update the configured default branch.
If the default branch is checked out, local changes are stashed and the worktree is reset to
`origin/<default>`. If another branch is checked out, that branch is left alone while the local
default branch ref is force-updated in the background. With `checkout_pr_branches = true`, watch also fetches:

```sh
git fetch --prune origin '+refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/pr/*/head'
```

Checkout logs are emitted at `info`. Set `log_level = "debug"` for cache/poll decisions:

```toml
[global]
log_level = "debug"
```

Watch checkout logs include repo start/finish, current branch mode, stash events, fetch/reset
steps, and before/after SHA fields for the updated default branch.

This mirrors GitHub PR heads into local `refs/remotes/pr/<number>/head` without spending REST
or GraphQL budget. Those refs are Git's copy of the PR head commits. They tell you which PR
heads exist and what commit each points at, but not PR titles, authors, reviews, labels, or CI
state. The fetch log includes `pr_heads_present` and `pr_heads_gone`.

Also starts the HTTP command server on `127.0.0.1:{cmd_port}` (see below).

A pidfile is written next to the database (`gh.pid`) on every `watch` start -- daemon or not --
and checked to prevent duplicate instances. A stale pidfile (dead process) is silently overwritten.

### `ghcache checkout <owner/name> <branch>`
Clone or update a single branch into `staging_folder`.

Checkout path convention: `{staging_folder}/{owner}/{name}`

Examples:
- `myorg/backend` branch `main`  → `~/src/staging/myorg/backend`
- `myorg/backend` branch `staging` → `~/src/staging/myorg/backend` (same dir, different branch reset)

First checkout: `gh repo clone owner/name dest` (full history, default branch).
The clone does not pass `--branch`, so repos with any default branch name work.
Subsequent checkouts: `git fetch origin branch && git reset --hard FETCH_HEAD`
(only runs if `branch.sha` in the DB differs from the last recorded checkout sha).
If the requested branch does not exist on the remote, the fetch is skipped with a warning.

Requires `staging_folder` in config. Requires the repo to exist in the DB (run `ghcache sync` first).

### `ghcache query <subcommand>`
Query cached data from SQLite without hitting the GitHub API.

| Subcommand | Key flags | Notes |
|------------|-----------|-------|
| `prs` | `--repo owner/name`, `--state open\|closed\|merged`, `--needs-review`, `--mine` | `--mine` resolves current user via `gh api user` |
| `pr <number> --repo owner/name` | | Single PR with reviews, comments, labels |
| `notifications` | `--all`, `--repo owner/name`, `--reason <reason>`, `--type <type>`, `--mark-read` | Default: unread only. `--mark-read` not yet implemented. |
| `events` | `--repo owner/name`, `--type <type>` | |
| `branches` | `--repo owner/name` | |
| `rate-limit` | | Last 50 API calls with rate info |
| `sql '<query>'` | | Raw SQL passthrough |

All subcommands accept `--format json\|json-pretty\|tsv\|table` (default: table on TTY, JSON when piped).

### `ghcache status`
Shows DB size, PR count, unread notification count, and recent poll state per endpoint.

### `ghcache config`
Prints the resolved config values (after tilde expansion, env var overrides, etc.).

### `ghcache db-path`
Prints the resolved database path. Useful for `sqlite3 $(ghcache db-path)`.

## HTTP command server

`ghcache watch` (and `ghcache watch --no-sync`) binds an HTTP server on `127.0.0.1:7748`
(configurable via `cmd_port` in `[global]`). Consumer processes use this to:

- **Register interest** in a repo and get its local path for direct `git2` reads
- **Receive live change events** via SSE as `change_log` rows are written
- **Pause / resume** the sync loop without restarting

### Endpoints

| Method | Path | Body | Description |
|--------|------|------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/events` | — | SSE stream of `change_log` rows. Send `Last-Event-ID: N` header to backfill from row N. |
| `POST` | `/subscribe` | `{"uuid":"…","owner":"…","repo":"…","pr_sync":true,"notifications":false}` | Clone/fetch the repo into `staging_folder`, return its local path, register it for dynamic sync. |
| `POST` | `/heartbeat` | `{"uuid":"…"}` | Refresh TTL for a subscription. Returns `{"ok":true/false}`. |
| `POST` | `/pause` | — | Pause the sync loop. |
| `POST` | `/resume` | — | Resume the sync loop. |

Subscriptions expire after `heartbeat_ttl_seconds` (default 30) without a heartbeat.
Active subscriptions drive dynamic PR sync and notifications sync beyond what is listed in config.

### SSE event format

Each event is one JSON object on a `data:` line:

```
id: 42
data: {"id":42,"entity_type":"pull_request","entity_id":7,"event":"updated","repo_slug":"myorg/backend","payload":{...},"occurred_at":"2026-03-25T10:00:00Z"}

```

### Config keys

```toml
[global]
cmd_port              = 7748   # HTTP server port (default 7748)
heartbeat_ttl_seconds = 30     # subscription TTL in seconds (default 30)
org_repo_discovery_interval_seconds = 3600  # repo-list discovery cadence; 0 = every sync pass
```

## Database

SQLite, WAL mode. Key tables:

| Table | Contents |
|-------|----------|
| `repo` | Repos from config |
| `branch` | Branches with SHA, ahead/behind counts |
| `pull_request` | Open and recently-closed PRs |
| `pr_review` | PR review states per author |
| `notification` | GitHub notifications |
| `repo_event` | Raw GitHub Events API payloads |
| `checkout` | Last recorded checkout SHA per branch |
| `call_log` | Every API call with timing and rate limit data |
| `change_log` | Append-only log of every entity change (IPC bus) |
| `poll_state` | ETag / Last-Modified per endpoint for conditional requests |

Views: `v_open_prs`, `v_unread_notifications`, `v_recent_events`, `v_rate_limit`.

## Rate limiting

Two pools are tracked independently: REST and GraphQL cost points.
When remaining capacity drops below a threshold, syncs sleep until the reset window.
Progressive back-off increases sleep duration as capacity drops further.

## Architecture

- `gh` CLI is the transport (inherits your existing `gh auth` credentials, no separate token needed)
- ETag / Last-Modified conditional requests mean most polls are free 304s
- Events API is the cheapest signal: one paginated REST call reveals which PR numbers changed
- Those PR numbers are batched into a single aliased GraphQL query per repo (targeted sync)
- `change_log` is an append-only table; the HTTP `/events` SSE endpoint tails it and pushes rows to subscribers
- `ghcache-client` is a companion Rust library with typed queries and an `EventStream` for the SSE feed -- see [ghcache-client/README.md](ghcache-client/README.md)

## Appendix: Security & I/O Bill of Materials

This section documents every I/O boundary in ghcache: what crosses the process boundary, in which direction, with what cardinality, and what security properties constrain it.

### I/O Boundary Summary

| Boundary | Direction | Cardinality | Auth | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-------------|------|-------|
| `gh api` (REST) | Outbound | 1 call per endpoint per poll interval per repo | Delegated to `gh` CLI | ETag/Last-Modified; most polls are free 304s |
| `gh api graphql` | Outbound | 1 call per repo per sync pass (batched) | Delegated to `gh` CLI | Multiple PRs aliased into single query |
| `gh repo clone` | Outbound | 1 per repo (first checkout only) | Delegated to `gh` CLI | Subsequent updates use `git fetch` |
| `git fetch` / `git reset` | Outbound | 1 per branch per sync pass (SHA-gated) | System SSH/git config | Skipped if DB SHA matches checkout SHA |
| HTTP server | Inbound | N concurrent SSE clients + command POSTs | None (loopback-only) | Bound to `127.0.0.1`, not `0.0.0.0` |
| SQLite writes | Local | 1 upsert per entity per sync pass | Filesystem permissions | WAL mode, foreign keys enforced |
| `change_log` inserts | Local | 1 per entity mutation (append-only) | Filesystem permissions | Immutable audit trail, tailed by SSE |
| `call_log` inserts | Local | 1 per API call (append-only) | Filesystem permissions | Rate limit telemetry, never updated |
| Config file read | Local | 1 at startup | Filesystem permissions | Read-only after startup |
| Pidfile | Local | 1 write at startup, 1 delete on exit | Filesystem permissions | Prevents concurrent instances |
| stdout JSON lines | Local | 1 per API call (opt-in) | Process stdout | Rate limit summaries and per-call detail |

### Filesystem Operations

| Path | Operation | Purpose | Source |
|------|-----------|---------|--------|
| `ghcache.toml` (various locations) | Read | Config loading | `src/config.rs:110` |
| `~/.config/ghcache/config.toml` | Write (via `init`) | Template creation | `src/main.rs:268` |

| `{staging_folder}/{owner}/{repo}/` | Read/Write | Git checkouts | `src/checkout.rs` |
| `{db_path}.pid` | Write/Delete | Pidfile for instance lock | `src/pidfile.rs` |

### SQLite Schema

| Table | Purpose | Write Pattern | Cardinality |
|-------|---------|---------------|-------------|
| `repo` | Configured repos | Upsert | 1 per configured repo |
| `branch` | Branch SHAs | Upsert | 1 per tracked branch per repo |
| `pull_request` | PR metadata | Upsert | 1 per open PR per repo per sync |
| `pr_review` | PR review states | Upsert | N per PR (one per reviewer) |
| `pr_label` | PR labels (junction) | Delete + Insert | N per PR (replaced in full each sync) |
| `pr_requested_reviewer` | Requested reviewers (junction) | Delete + Insert | N per PR (replaced in full each sync) |
| `pr_status_check` | CI status checks | Upsert | N per PR (one per context) |
| `notification` | GitHub notifications | Upsert | 1 per notification |

| `checkout` | Last checkout SHA per branch | Upsert | 1 per checked-out branch |
| `call_log` | Every API call with rate limit data | Append-only | 1 row per API call, never deleted |

| `poll_state` | ETag/Last-Modified per endpoint | Upsert | 1 per polled endpoint |
| `subscription` | HTTP subscriber state | In-memory | Transient, not persisted |

### Data Leaving the Machine

| Data | Destination | Trigger | Cardinality |
|------|-------------|---------|-------------|
| GitHub API requests (repo/org/branch identifiers, pagination cursors, ETags) | `api.github.com` | Sync operations | Bounded by configured repos x poll interval |
| SSE events to local subscribers | `127.0.0.1:{cmd_port}` | `change_log` inserts | 1 broadcast per mutation per connected client |

### Data Stored Locally

| Data | Sensitivity | Location |
|------|-------------|----------|
| GitHub API responses (PR content, event payloads) | Medium | SQLite `*_json` columns |
| Rate limit state | Low | SQLite `call_log`, `poll_state` |
| Git repository contents | High (full source code) | `{staging_folder}` |
| Auth tokens | **None** | Delegated to `gh` CLI keychain |

### Security Properties

- **No tokens stored** -- auth delegated to `gh` CLI (uses OS keychain). ghcache never reads, logs, or caches credentials.
- **Loopback-only HTTP** -- command server binds `127.0.0.1`, not `0.0.0.0`. No authentication on the HTTP server; security relies on network isolation.
- **No outbound HTTP client** -- all network egress goes through `gh` subprocess invocation, not a direct HTTP client in the ghcache process.
- **Conditional requests** -- ETag/Last-Modified headers on every REST call minimize data transfer and API quota consumption.
- **Idempotent writes** -- `INSERT OR IGNORE` / `ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` prevent duplication from retries or overlapping syncs.
- **Append-only audit logs** -- `call_log` and `change_log` are insert-only with auto-timestamps. No UPDATE or DELETE operations target these tables.
- **PID-based instance lock** -- pidfile with `libc::kill(pid, 0)` liveness check prevents concurrent watch daemons on the same database.
- **No user-controlled SQL** -- dynamic query construction in `query/prs.rs` uses manual escaping (`'` to `''`), not string interpolation of raw input.
